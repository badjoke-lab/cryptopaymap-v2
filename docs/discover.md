# Discover roadmap notes

## PR-1 (UI shell)

- `/discover` now renders the v0.1 UI shell using local mock datasets only.
- All section-level loading, empty, and error states are handled in UI components.
- Stories open in an in-page modal and do not use route pages.

## Next step (PR-2)

- Wire Discover sections to dedicated API endpoints and replace mock payloads.
